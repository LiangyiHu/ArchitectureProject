 Computer Systems Architecture Project
====================

## Instruction

[CSCI 6461](http://home.gwu.edu/~mlancast/CSCI6461Section10Fall2016/) programmed computer simulation of a small processor with performance improvements with Java.


## Part 1 (finished)

Design and implement the basic machine architecture

Implement a simple memory

Execute Load and Store instructions

Build initial user interface to simulator

## Part 2 (finished)

Design and implement the modules for enhanced memory and cache operations

Implement all instructions except for MSR, CHK, and 

Floating Point/Vector operations

Extend the user interface

Demonstrate 1st program running on your simulator

## Part 3 (finished)

Make sure all instructions (as specified below) execute on your simulator

Demonstrate 2nd program running on your simulator

## Part 4 (current)

Design and implement the modules for floating point and vector operations and simple pipelining; extend the user interface

Design and implement simple branch prediction and speculative execution, trap if an error occurs to an error handling routine
